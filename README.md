# curl2httpie

A command-line tool that converts curl commands to HTTPie syntax. It reads the curl command from your clipboard, converts it to HTTPie syntax, and:
1. Copies the converted command back to your clipboard
2. Creates a .http file for use with REST Client extensions

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/curl2httpie.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd curl2httpie

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install globally (optional)
npm install -g .
```

## Usage

1. Copy a curl command to your clipboard
2. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   curl2httpie
   ```
3. The tool will:
   - Convert the command to HTTPie syntax
   - Copy the converted command to your clipboard
   - Create a .http file in the current directory
   - Display both the original and converted commands in the terminal

The generated .http file will be named based on the service name from the URL (e.g., `api-example-data.http`) and includes:
- The original curl command as a comment
- The equivalent HTTPie command as a comment
- The request in REST Client format
- Timestamp of conversion

### Example

Original curl command:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/data" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}'
```

Will be converted to HTTPie syntax:
```bash
http POST https://api.example.com/data Content-Type:application/json key=value
```

And will create a file named `api-example-data.http` containing:
```http
### POST https://api.example.com/data

# HTTPie equivalent:
# http POST https://api.example.com/data Content-Type:application/json key=value

POST https://api.example.com/data
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "key": "value"
}
```
